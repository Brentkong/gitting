The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the Queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well now they know

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on, the cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand
And here I stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back,
The past is in the past

Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on,
The cold never bothered me anyway
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules, and so do I
A full commitment is what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you, understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you

Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie, and hurt you

We've known each other, for so long
Your heart's been aching but, you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too hot to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around, and desert you

Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
never gonna tell a lie, and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around, and desert you

Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
never gonna tell a lie, and hurt you

Give you up
Never gonna give, never gonna give
Give you up
Never gonna give, never gonna give

We've known each other, for so long
Your heart's been aching but, you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it

I just wanna tell you how I'm feelin
Gotta make you, understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around, and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
never gonna tell a lie, and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around, and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
never gonna tell a lie, and hurt you
